* python for +delphi+ /free pascal/

This is @tangentstorm's personal fork of the excellent [[https://code.google.com/p/python4delphi/][python4delphi]].

The files in this top directory are my own, everything else is from the official SVN, except for a few changes I've made in [[https://github.com/tangentstorm/py4d/blob/master/PythonForDelphi/Components/Sources/Core/PythonEngine.pas][PythonEngine.pas]] to get things working on FreeBSD.

** Files in this directory

- =simplefpcdemo.pas= :: example of invoking python from a simple free pascal program, outside of lazarus.

- =upykvm.pas= :: unit that wraps my text terminal libraries (from [[https://github.com/tangentstorm/xpl][@tangentstorm/xpl]] at github) for use with python

- =_pykvm.pas= :: exposes upykvm as a python extension module.

- =pkvm.sh= :: a tiny shell script to rebuild the extension module
